# Amazon-Sales-Analytics-dashboard

Hi TechCubies,

This is the my 1st Data Analytics project which I have made with one of the most pwoerful Data Analytics tool: PowerBi
This is the Amazon Sales Analytics Data which is representing the following data
1. Count of Order
2. Sum of profit
3. Sum of Sales
4. Graphical representation of Sales by order date
5. Sum of sales by Country
6. Sum of profit by state
7. And the most important for almost all companies i.e. The final target and the achieved target

   This has been made by using Chatgpt and Powerbi
