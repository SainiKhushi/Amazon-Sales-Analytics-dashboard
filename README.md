# Amazon-Sales-Analytics-dashboard

Hi TechCubies,

I'm thrilled to present my very first Data Analytics project, created using one of the most powerful Data Analytics tools: Power BI. This project, titled "Amazon Sales Analytics Dashboard," showcases the following key metrics:

1. Order Count: Total number of orders processed.
2. Total Profit: Sum of profits generated.
3. Total Sales: Sum of sales revenue.
4. Sales Trend: Graphical representation of sales by order date.
5. Sales by Country: Breakdown of total sales by country.
6. Profit by State: Breakdown of total profits by state.
7. Target Analysis: Comparison of final targets versus achieved targetsâ€”a crucial metric for almost all companies.
   
This dashboard was crafted with the assistance of ChatGPT and Power BI.
